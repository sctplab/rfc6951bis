<abstract>
<t>This document describes a simple method of encapsulating Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP) packets into UDP packets and its limitations.
This allows the usage of SCTP in networks with legacy NATs that do not support
SCTP.
It can also be used to implement SCTP on hosts without directly accessing
the IP layer, for example, implementing it as part of the application without
requiring special privileges.</t>
<t>Please note that this document only describes the functionality
needed within an SCTP stack to add on UDP encapsulation, providing
only those mechanisms for two end-hosts to communicate with each
other over UDP ports.
In particular, it does not provide mechanisms to determine whether
UDP encapsulation is being used by the peer, nor the mechanisms for
determining which remote UDP port number can be used.
These functions are out of scope for this document.</t>
<t>This document covers only end-hosts and not tunneling (egress or ingress)
endpoints.</t>

<name>Introduction</name>
<t>This document describes a simple method of encapsulating SCTP packets into
UDP packets.
SCTP, as defined in <xref target='RFC9260'/>, runs directly over IPv4 or IPv6.
There are two main reasons for encapsulating SCTP packets:</t>
<ul>
<li><t>To allow SCTP traffic to pass through NATs, which do not provide
native SCTP support.</t></li>
<li><t>To allow SCTP to be implemented on hosts that do not provide direct
access to the IP layer.
In particular, applications can use their own SCTP implementation if the
operating system does not provide one.</t></li>
</ul>
<t>SCTP provides the necessary congestion control and reliability service
that UDP does not perform.</t>

<section anchor='use_cases'>
<name>Use Cases</name>
<t>This section discusses two important use cases for encapsulating
SCTP into UDP.</t>
<section>
<name>Portable SCTP Implementations</name>
<t>Some operating systems support SCTP natively.
For other operating systems, implementations are available but require
special privileges to install and/or use them.
In some cases, a kernel implementation might not be available at all.
When providing an SCTP implementation as part of a user process, most operating
systems require special privileges to access the IP layer directly.</t>

<t>Using UDP encapsulation makes it possible to provide an
SCTP implementation as part of a user process that does not
require any special privileges.</t>

<t>A crucial point for implementing SCTP in user space is that the
source address of outgoing packets needs to be controlled.
This is not an issue if the SCTP stack can use all addresses configured
at the IP layer as source addresses.
However, it is an issue when also using the address management needed for
NAT traversal, described in <xref target='emb_addrs'/>.</t>
</section>

<section>
<name>Legacy NAT Traversal</name>
<t>Using UDP encapsulation allows SCTP communication when traversing NATs not
supporting SCTP.
For single-homed associations, IP addresses <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be listed in
the INIT and INIT-ACK chunks.
To use multiple addresses, the dynamic address reconfiguration extension
described in <xref target='RFC5061'/> <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used only with
wildcard addresses in the ASCONF chunks (Address Configuration Change Chunks)
in combination with <xref target='RFC4895'/>.</t>
<t>For multihomed SCTP associations, the address management
as described in <xref target='emb_addrs'/> <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be performed.</t>
<t>SCTP sends periodic HEARTBEAT chunks on all idle paths.
These can keep the NAT state alive.</t>
<t>If multiple SCTP endpoints are operating be a NAT, the local SCTP port
numbers used by the SCTP endpoints <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> all be different.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section>
<name>Unilateral Self-Address Fixing (UNSAF) Considerations</name>
<t>As <xref target='RFC3424'/> requires a limited scope,
this document only covers SCTP endpoints dealing with legacy constraints
as described in <xref target='use_cases'/>.
It doesn't cover generic tunneling endpoints.</t>
<t>Obviously, the exit strategy is to use hosts supporting SCTP natively and
middleboxes supporting SCTP.</t>
</section>

<section>
<name>SCTP over UDP</name>
<section anchor='arch'>
<name>Architectural Considerations</name>
<t>UDP-encapsulated SCTP is normally communicated between SCTP stacks
using the IANA-assigned UDP port number 9899 (sctp-tunneling) on both
ends.
There are circumstances where other ports <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used on either
end: As stated earlier, implementations in the application space
might be need to use ports other than the registered port.
Since NAT boxes might change UDP port numbers, the receiver might observe other
UDP port numbers than were used by the sender.
Discovery of alternate ports is outside of the scope of this document,
but this section describes considerations for SCTP stack design in light
of their potential use.</t>

<t>Each SCTP stack uses a single local UDP encapsulation port number as
the destination port for all its incoming SCTP packets.
While the uniqueness of the local UDP encapsulation port number is not
necessarily needed for the protocol, this greatly simplifies implementation
design, since different ports for each address would require a sender
implementation to choose the appropriate port while doing source address
selection.
Using a single local UDP encapsulation port number per host is not possible
if the SCTP stack is implemented as part of each application, there are multiple
applications, and some of the applications want to use the same IP address.</t>

<t>An SCTP implementation supporting UDP encapsulation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
maintain a remote UDP encapsulation port number per destination address for each
SCTP association.
Again, because the remote stack <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be using ports other
than the well-known port, each port <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be different from each
stack.
However, because of remapping of ports by NATs, the remote ports associated
with different remote IP addresses <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> not be identical,
even if they are associated with the same stack.</t>

<t>Implementation note: Because the well-known port might not be used,
implementations need to allow other port numbers to be specified as a
local or remote UDP encapsulation port number through APIs.</t>

<section>
<name>SCTP/UDP/IPv4 Packet Format</name>
<t>To encapsulate an SCTP packet, a UDP header
as defined in <xref target='RFC0768'/> is inserted between
the IP header as defined in <xref target='RFC0791'/>
and the SCTP common header as defined in <xref target='RFC9260'/>.</t>

is removed.
Then, the generic lookup is performed, as done by an SCTP stack whenever a

After finding the SCTP association (which includes checking the verification
tag), the UDP source port <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be stored as the encapsulation

<t>When receiving ICMP or ICMPv6 response packets, there might not

If a received ICMP or ICMPv6 packet cannot be related to a specific
SCTP association or the verification tag cannot be verified,
it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be discarded silently.
In particular, this means that the SCTP stack <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> rely on
receiving ICMP or ICMPv6 messages.
Implementation constraints could prevent processing received
ICMP or ICMPv6 messages.</t>
<t>If received ICMP or ICMPv6 messages are processed, the following mapping

<ol>
<li><t>ICMP messages with type 'Destination Unreachable' and code

If it stops encapsulating them, the Path MTU <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be increased

<t>Since one cannot rely on the feedback provided by ICMP or ICMPv6 due to the
limitation laid out in <xref target='icmp_cons'/>, <xref target='RFC8899'/>
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be followed, when performing Path MTU discovery.</t>
<t>If the implementation does not allow control of the Don't Fragment (DF) bit
contained in the IPv4 header, then Path MTU discovery can't be used.
In this case, an implementation-specific value <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used

<name>Get or Set the Remote UDP Encapsulation Port Number
      (SCTP_REMOTE_UDP_ENCAPS_PORT)</name>
<t>This socket option can be used to set and retrieve the UDP encapsulation
port number.
This allows an endpoint to encapsulate initial packets.</t>
<artwork>
struct sctp_udpencaps {
  sctp_assoc_t sue_assoc_id;
  struct sockaddr_storage sue_address;
  uint16_t sue_port;
};
</artwork>
<dl newline="true">
<dt>sue_assoc_id:</dt>
<dd><t>This parameter is ignored for one-to-one style sockets.
For one-to-many style sockets, the application might fill in an association
identifier or SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC for this query.
It is an error to use SCTP_{CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC in sue_assoc_id.</t></dd>
<dt>sue_address:</dt>
<dd><t>This specifies which address is of interest.
If a wildcard address is provided, it applies only to future paths.</t></dd>
<dt>sue_port:</dt>
<dd><t>The UDP port number in network byte order; used as the destination port
number for UDP encapsulation.
Providing a value of 0 disables UDP encapsulation.</t></dd>

<section>
<name>Middlebox Considerations</name>
<t>Middleboxes often use different timeouts for UDP based flows than
for other flows.
Therefore the HEARTBEAT.Interval parameter <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be lowered to
15 seconds when UDP encapsulation is used.</t>

<section>
<name>IANA Considerations</name>
<t>[NOTE to RFC-Editor: "RFCXXXX" is to be replaced by the RFC number you
assign this document.]</t>
<t>[NOTE to RFC-Editor: The requested values for the cause code are tentative
and to be confirmed by IANA.]</t>
<t>A new error cause code has to be assigned by IANA.
This requires an additional line in the "Error Cause Codes" registry for
SCTP:</t>
<table>
<name>New Entry in Error Cause Codes Registry</name>
<thead>
<tr><th>Value</th>           <th>Cause Code                                           </th> <th>Reference</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>14 (suggested) </td> <td>Restart of an Association with New Encapsulation Port</td> <td>[RFCXXXX]</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<t>This document refers to the already assigned UDP port 9899 (sctp-tunneling).
IANA is requested to update this assignment to refer to [RFCXXXX].
As per <xref target='RFC6335'/>, the Assignee is [IESG] and the Contact is
[IETF_Chair].</t>

<section>
<name>Security Considerations</name>
<t>Encapsulating SCTP into UDP does not add any additional
security considerations to the ones given in
<xref target='RFC9260'/> and
<xref target='RFC5061'/>.</t>
<t>Firewalls inspecting SCTP packets need also to be aware of the encapsulation
and apply corresponding rules to the encapsulated packets.</t>
<t>An attacker might send a malicious UDP packet towards an SCTP endpoint
to change the encapsulation port for a single remote address of
a particular SCTP association.
However, as specified in <xref target='decaps'/>, this requires the usage
of one of the two negotiated verification tags.
This protects against blind attackers the same way as described
in <xref target='RFC9260'/> for SCTP over IPv4 or IPv6.
Non-blind attackers can affect SCTP association using the UDP encapsulation
described in this document in the same way as SCTP associations not
using the UDP encapsulation of SCTP described here.</t>
