<abstract>
<t>RFC 6951 specifies the UDP encapsulation of SCTP packets.
The described handling of received packets requires the check of the
verification tag. However, RFC 6951 misses a specification of the
handling of received packets for which this check is not possible.</t>
<t>This document updates RFC 6951 by specifying the handling of received
packets for which the verification tag can not be checked.</t>

<section anchor='intro'>
<name>Introduction</name>
<t><xref target="RFC6951"/> specifies the UDP encapsulation of SCTP packets.
To be able to adopt automatically to changes of the remote UDP encapsulation
port number, it is updated when processing received packets.
This includes automatic enabling and disabling of UDP encapsulation.</t>
<t>Section 5.4 of <xref target="RFC6951"/> describes the processing of 
received packets and requires the check of the verification tag before
updating the remote UDP encapsulation port and the possible enabling or
disabling of UDP encapsulation.</t>
<t><xref target="RFC6951"/> basically misses a description of the handling
of received packets where checking the verification tag is not possible.
This includes packets for which no association can be found and
packets containing an INIT chunk, since the verification tag of these
packets is 0.</t>

<name>Conventions</name>
<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/>  when,
and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
</section>

<section>
<name>Handling of Out of the Blue Packets</name>
<t>If the processing of an out of the blue packet requires the sending
of a packet in response according to the rules specified in Section 8.4 of
<xref target="RFC4960"/>, the following rules apply:</t>
<ol>
<li>
<t>If the received packet was encapsulated in UDP, the response packets
MUST also be encapsulated in UDP.
The UDP source port and UDP destination port used for sending the response
packet are the UDP destination port and UDP source port of the received
packet.</t>
</li>
<li>
<t>If the received packet was not encapsulated in UDP, the response packet
MUST NOT be encapsulated in UDP.</t>
</li>
</ol>
<t>Please note that in these cases a check of the verification tag is not
possible.</t>
</section>

<section>
<name>Handling of SCTP Packets Containing an INIT Chunk Matching an Existing Associations</name>
<t>SCTP packets containing an INIT chunk have the verification tag 0 in
the common header. Therefore the verification tag can't be checked.</t>
<t>The following rules apply when processing the received packet:</t>
<ol>
<li><t>The remote UDP encapsulation port for the source address of the received
SCTP packet MUST NOT be updated if the encapsulation of outgoing packets is
enabled and the received SCTP packet is encapsulated.</t></li>
<li><t>The UDP encapsulation for outgoing packets towards the source address
of the received SCTP packet MUST NOT be enabled, if it is disabled and the
received SCTP packet is encapsulated.</t></li>
<li><t>The UDP encapsulation for outgoing packets towards the source address
of the received SCTP packet MUST NOT be disabled, if it is enabled
and the received SCTP packet is not encapsulated.</t></li>
<li><t>If the UDP encapsulation for outgoing packets towards the source address
of the received SCTP packet is disabled and the received SCTP packet is
encapsulated, an SCTP packet containing an ABORT chunk MUST be sent.
The ABORT chunk MAY include the error cause defined below indicating an
"Restart of an Association with New Encapsulation Port".
This packet containing the ABORT chunk MUST be encapsulated in UDP.
The UDP source port and UDP destination port used for sending the
packet containing the ABORT chunk are the UDP destination port and
UDP source port of the received packet containing the INIT chunk.</t></li>
<li><t>If the UDP encapsulation for outgoing packets towards the source address
of the received SCTP packet is disabled and the received SCTP packet is
not encapsulated, the processing defined in <xref target="RFC4960"/>
MUST be performed. If a packet is sent in response, it MUST NOT be
encapsulated.</t></li>
<li><t>If the UDP encapsulation for outgoing packets towards the source address
of the received SCTP packet is enabled and the received SCTP packet is not
encapsulated, an SCTP packet containing an ABORT chunk MUST be sent.
The ABORT chunk MAY include the error cause defined below indicating an
"Restart of an Association with New Encapsulation Port".
This packet containing the ABORT chunk MUST NOT be encapsulated in UDP.</t></li>
<li><t>If the UDP encapsulation for outgoing packets towards the source address
of the received SCTP packet is enabled and the received SCTP packet is
encapsulated, but the UDP source port of the received SCTP packet is not
equal to the remote UDP encapsulation port for the source address of the
received SCTP packet, an SCTP packet containing an ABORT chunk MUST be sent.
The ABORT chunk MAY include the error cause defined below indicating an
"Restart of an Association with New Encapsulation Port".
This packet containing the ABORT chunk MUST be encapsulated in UDP.
The UDP source port and UDP destination port used for sending the
packet containing the ABORT chunk are the UDP destination port and
UDP source port of the received packet containing the INIT chunk.</t></li>
<li><t>If the UDP encapsulation for outgoing packets towards the source address
of the received SCTP packet is enabled and the received SCTP packet is
encapsulated and the UDP source port of the received SCTP packet is
equal to the remote UDP encapsulation port for the source address of the
received SCTP packet, the processing defined in <xref target="RFC4960"/>
MUST be performed. If a packet is sent in response, it MUST be
encapsulated.
The UDP source port and UDP destination port used for sending the
packet containing the ABORT chunk are the UDP destination port and
UDP source port of the received packet containing the INIT chunk.</t></li>
</ol>

<t>The error cause indicating an
"Restart of an Association with New Encapsulation Port" is defined by the
following figure.</t>

<section>
<name>Middlebox Considerations</name>
<t>Middleboxes often use different timeouts for UDP based flows than
for other flows. Therefore the HEARTBEAT.Interval parameter SHOULD be
lowered to 15 seconds when UDP encapsulation is used.</t>
</section>

<section>
<name>IANA Considerations</name>
<t>[NOTE to RFC-Editor: "RFCXXXX" is to be replaced by the RFC number you
assign this document.]</t>
<t>[NOTE to RFC-Editor: The requested values for the cause code are tentative
and to be confirmed by IANA.]</t>
<t>This document (RFCXXXX) is the reference for the registration
described in this section.</t>
<t>A new error cause code has to be assigned by IANA.
This requires an additional line in the "Error Cause Codes" registry for
SCTP:</t>
<table>
<name>New entry in Error Cause Codes registry</name>
<thead>
<tr><th>Value</th> <th>Cause Code                                           </th> <th>Reference</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>14   </td> <td>Restart of an Association with New Encapsulation Port</td> <td>[RFCXXXX]</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</section>

<section>
<name>Security Considerations</name>
<t>This document does not change the considerations given in
<xref target="RFC6951"/>.</t>
<t>However, not following the procedures given in this document might allow
an attacker to take over SCTP associations. The attacker needs only to
share the IP address of an existing SCTP association.</t>
<t>It should also be noted that if firewalls will be applied at the
SCTP association level they have to take the UDP encapsulation into
account.</t>
